TODO
- Fit the beta parameter using multinomial regression & use external valences
- Simulate equilibrium positions for the model from paper

- Check multinomial logistic regression implementation for the model with calculated valences 

- Write down and formalize the DS model
- Implement the DS model

- How to merge the two approaches?

FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS:
- Check how it evolved for years in the past
- Do the same for other countries
- Introduce new variables
