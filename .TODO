TODO
- Fit the beta parameter using multinomial regression & use external valences ---> no need to fit, for our [0,1] scaling, anything bigger than or equal to 0.5 works

- Check multinomial logistic regression implementation for the model with calculated valences 

- Simulate equilibrium positions for both models [calculated and external valences]

- Write down and formalize the DS model
- Implement the DS model

- How to merge the two approaches?

FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS:
- Check how it evolved for years in the past
- Do the same for other countries
- Introduce new variables
