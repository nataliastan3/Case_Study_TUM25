TODO
- Implement opinion dynamics model

- Add directions in axis labels of the plot (i.e. Democracy ---> Authoritarian-Democratic)
- Gaussian KDE with initial and equilibrium positions 

- Load voter data from previous years back to 2007
    - Voter data twice for 2021
    - Make the year of data used a parameter of loading functions 
    - use same year as voter data for party manifestos as well

- Run the model for past years and compare results
    - LINKE not present for 2024 external valences


FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS:
- Run model for other countries
- Introduce new variables to utility function (u_ij = lambda_j - beta*||x_i-z_j||**2 + constant*sociodemographic_var + constant_2*external_valence)
    - sociodemographic variables
    - external valences
