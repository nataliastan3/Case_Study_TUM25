TODO

- Beta parameter experimenting
- Normalize external valences and rerun with new valences
- Check Data from previous times back to 2007
- reconsider feature space 
- look at software for papers
- Simulate equilibrium positions for both models [calculated and external valences]
    - Case with both eigenvalues being positive?

- Write down and formalize the DS model
- Implement the DS model

- How to merge the two approaches?

FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS:

- Check how it evolved for years in the past
- Do the same for other countries
- Introduce new variables 
    - sociodemographic variables
    - external valences
