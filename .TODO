TODO
- pick features that are in both surveys --- Done_to be checked
- get party positions as mean of partys voters --- Done_to be checked
    - does it make sense with the regression using voters mean and manifesto data?
    - Problem with scaling, see e.g. Democracy Mean vs Democracy Mean Scaled
      Min max scaling really the right tool?
- check model from paper, how to proceed with equilibriums? 
- What to do with external valences?
- Come up with a DS approach concept
- How to merge the two approaches?
- Speed up and maybe break up get_scaled_party_voter_data to make it more clear

FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS:
- Check how it evolved for years in the past
- Do the same for other countries
- Introduce new variables
